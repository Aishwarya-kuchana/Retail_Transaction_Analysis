# 🛍️ Retail Transaction Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of retail transaction data to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance.  
The analysis identifies key business drivers and patterns that can help improve sales strategy and promotional planning.

---

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Techniques:** EDA, Time-Series Analysis

---

### ⚙️ Steps & Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Ensured consistent data types across 15 columns.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created 6 new time-based columns: `Date`, `Time`, `Month`, `Day of Week`, `City`, `State`.  
   - Derived total sales amount and discount percentage metrics.

3. **Exploratory Analysis:**  
   - Generated 20+ visualizations to study sales by city, time, and discount.  
   - Identified seasonal peaks and top-performing product categories.

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Built a **3-page interactive Power BI dashboard** showcasing:
     - Sales by Region and Month  
     - Top Products & Discounts  
     - Revenue Contribution by City

### 📊 Key Insights
- Peak sales occurred on weekends and during discount periods.  
- Specific cities contributed the majority of total sales revenue.  
- Higher discounts correlated with larger order quantities but lower profit margins.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on practice with EDA workflow and visualization techniques.  
- Strengthened understanding of **feature engineering** and **sales trend analysis**.  
- Gained experience integrating Python and Power BI in a data analytics workflow.
